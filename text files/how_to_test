user models:
    simple user : cares about genre and has biases for them

tests:
    simple genre test : take genres bias and weight it with genre array


vs random:
    take a number of users
    have them "watch a movie"
    recommend movies to them
    compare which system gives them what they want
    compare weight of genre bias
    use binomial distribution to prove that system aren't equal
